# gov1006-finalproject-2.0

Paper replication final project for Gov 1006 in which I am replicating a 2018 paper by Paul C. Bauer entitled "Unemployment, Trust in Government, and Satisfaction with Democracy: An Empirical Investigation".

The replication materials for Bauer's work, as well as his paper, are available in the Dataverse folder of my Github repo.

To replicate my paper, first run the analysis.Rmd file followed by the milestone8.Rmd file which will produce the pdf of my paper.
