# GOV 1006: Paper Replication

Paper replication final project for Gov 1006 in which I am replicating a 2018 paper by Paul C. Bauer entitled "Unemployment, Trust in Government, and Satisfaction with Democracy: An Empirical Investigation".

The replication materials for Bauer's work, as well as his paper, are available in the Dataverse folder of my Github repo. The code for my replication of Bauer's paper is available in the replication_code.Rmd file.

To replicate my paper, first run the analysis.Rmd file followed by the paper.Rmd file which will produce the pdf of my paper.
